### Recruiter Workflow Agent

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered recruitment workflow using LangGraph, LangChain, and Groq LLMs.

The agent automatically:

Categorizes candidate applications into Entry-level, Mid-level, or Senior-level

Matches skills against a Python Developer job description

Routes candidates to the correct outcome:

Schedule HR Interview

Escalate to Recruiter

Reject Application

The workflow is represented as a graph, making the candidate evaluation process transparent and easy to modify.
